## Tutorial Description

Models in computational neuroscience are typically used to reproduce and explain
experimental findings, to draw new hypotheses from their predictive power, to undertake the
low observability of the brain, etc. However, computational models can also be employed to
interact directly with living nervous systems, which is a powerful way of unveiling key neural
dynamics by combining experimental and theoretical efforts. However, protocols that
simultaneously combine recordings from living neurons and input/outputs from computational
models are not easy to design or implement. In this tutorial, we will describe several tools and
techniques to build such kind of open and closed-loop interactions: from basic dynamic-clamp
approaches to build hybrid circuits to more complex configurations that can include several
interacting living and artificial elements. We will emphasize the need of open-source real-time
software technology for some of these interactions.

In particular, we will focus on two software packages that can implement closed-loop
interactions between living neurons and computational neuroscience models. The first one,
RTHybrid, is a solution to build hybrid circuits between living neurons and models. This
program, developed by the organizers, includes a library of neuron and synapse models and
different algorithms for the automatic calibration and adaptation of hybrid configurations. The
second software tool, RTXI, allows to program specific modules to implement a wide variety of
closed-loop configurations and includes many handy modularization and visualization tools.
Both programs can be used in very wide contexts of hybrid experimental design and deal with
real-time constraints. During the tutorial, we will show how to install and use these programs
in standard computer platforms, and we will provide attendees the possibility of building and
testing their first designs.

## Software tools

RTHybrid: <https://github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid>

RTXI: <http://rtxi.org/>

**Important:** For the practical part of the tutorial, please download beforehand the latest RTXI version from <http://rtxi.org/install/> and install it. It is not necesary to install it completely in your computer for this tutorial, you can just burn the image to a live-USB following the instructions on the web or install it on a Virtual Machine.
